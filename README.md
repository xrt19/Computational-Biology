# Computational Biology (Laboratory) Course

This repository contains summaries and coding examples from my Computational Biology (Laboratory) course. Each session focuses on different aspects of bioinformatics, utilizing Python and BioPython for various analyses. Below is a breakdown of the topics covered:

## Session 1: Sequence Analysis using BioPython
- Sequence analysis, including sequence manipulation and nucleotide frequency plotting.

## Session 2: DNA Composition Analysis
- GC/AT composition analysis on DNA.
- DNA melting point calculations.
- Nucleotide molecular weight calculations.

## Session 3: Protein Synthesis
- Protein synthesis using amino acid codon tables.

## Session 4: Sequence Alignment Using BioPython
- Global and local alignment techniques.
- Similarity analysis.
- Distance calculations (Hamming, Levenshtein, Dot Plot).

## Session 5: Working with Biological GenBank Files
- Working with FASTA files.
- Working with PDB files.
- Performing protein exploratory data analysis.
